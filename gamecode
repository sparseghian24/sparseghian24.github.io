#pseudo code (steps)
# 1) loop through the maximum number of turns around
# - how many turns/wrong guesses is user allowed -->  #   6? (until hangman man runs out of body parts- 2 # 
#   hands/head/body/2 legs)
# - as long as u get them right u continue to get 
#   chances but once u get 6 wrong game is over 

# 2) get a guess from the player 
# 3) check guess (see if letter is in word)
# - if letter is in word, add it to the word
# - if letter not in word, add to number of wrong counts and
# 4) check if word is complete 
# - if word is complete, break out of loop (yay u won word is complete)
# 5) if out of tries and word is not complete, break out of loop and say u lost (tell user what the word actualy was)
